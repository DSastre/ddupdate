Under debian, the packaged version runs the ddupdate service under the
user ddupdate, which is automatically created. As a consequence, the
.netrc file used by the service is /var/lib/ddupdate/.netrc. This file
needs to be updatet with credentials required to perform operations,
see the README.md file.

Also, the file needs to be owned by ddupdate and have 600 permissions.
