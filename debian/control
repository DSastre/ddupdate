Description: Tool updating DNS data for dynamic IP addresses
 Updates dynamic IP addresses typically obtained using DHCP with dynamic
 DNS services such as changeip.com, duckdns.org or no-ip.com. This makes
 it possible to access a machine with a fixed name like myhost.duckdns.org
 even if the ip address changes. It is a linux-centric, user-friendly and
 secure alternative to the ubiquotious ddclient(8)
 .
 ddupdate has a plugin structure with plugins for obtaining the actual
 address (typically hardware-dependent) and to update it (service depen‚Äê
 dent). It is distributed with systemd support to run at regular intervals
 and with NetworkManager templates to run when interfaces goes up or down.
