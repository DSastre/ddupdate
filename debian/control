Description: Tool updating DNS data for dynamic IP addresses
 A tool to update dynamic IP addresses typically obtained using DHCP
 at dynamic DNS services such as changeip.com, duckdns.org no-ip.com.
 The goal is that it should be possible to access a machine with a fixed
 name like myhost.duckdns.org even if the ip address changes. ddupdate
 caches the address, and only attempts the update if the address actually
 is changed
 .
 The tool has a plugin structure with plugins for obtaining the actual
 address (typically hardware-dependent) and to update it (service depen‚Äê
 dent). For supported services it's a linux-centric, user-friendly and
 flexible alternative to the uiquotious ddclient.
 .
 ddupdate is distributed with systemd support to run at regular intervals,
 and with NetworkManager templates to run when interfaces goes up or down.
