Description: Tool updating DNS data for dynamic IP addresses
 A tool to update dynamic IP addresses typically obtained using DHCP
 at dynamic DNS services such as changeip.com, duckdns.org or no-ip.com.
 It makes it possible to access a machine with a fixed name like 
 myhost.duckdns.org even if the ip address changes.
 .
 The tool has a plugin structure with plugins for obtaining the actual
 address (typically hardware-dependent) and to update it (service depen‚Äê
 dent). For supported services it's a linux-centric, user-friendly and
 flexible alternative to the ubiquotious ddclient.
 .
 ddupdate caches the address, and only attempts the update if the address 
 actually is changed. It is distributed with systemd support to run at 
 regular intervals, and with NetworkManager templates to run when interfaces 
 goes up or down.
